# Do not quote any strings here
#
# In git this file is named .env_template
# but once deployed it will be named .env
# This allows us to deliver an upgraded template in future versions
# without overwritting the current file then merge the two.

# These are to qualify the image name/path in docker-compose.yml
# and should be tied to the release being deployed
